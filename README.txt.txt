This folder contains Python TensorFlow code for a dank meme classifier. To use it, you will need to dump all of your memes into a series of subdirectories of some base directory (for me, it was "B:/memes/resizedmemes/") and edit the hard-coded lists in "deepFriedModel.py" to point to the meme subdirectories which _you_ want classified as dank/normie. With the default parameters here, the dank/normie meme classifier usually obtains very high accuracy on the test set (~98%-99%)

This repo also contains some code related to a failed implementation Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network for memes, in case you are curious.
